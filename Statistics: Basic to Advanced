Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole.\n\nFor example, if reporter have to provide an exit-poll for the election, they don't ask whole population of the state but some sample selected from the population, by which they conclude the exit-poll for the whole population. So, sample-people is sample data and whole population of state is population data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Sampling Techniques","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In statistics, quality assurance, and survey methodology, `sampling is the selection of a subset or a statistical sample (termed sample for short) of individuals from within a statistical population to estimate characteristics of the whole population`. The subset is meant to reflect the whole population and statisticians attempt to collect samples that are representative of the population. \n>Sampling has lower costs and faster data collection compared to recording data from the entire population, and thus, it can provide insights in cases where it is infeasible to measure an entire population.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Simple_random_sampling.PNG/450px-Simple_random_sampling.PNG)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.

Ratio - A ratio scale is a quantitative scale where there is a true zero and equal intervals between neighboring points.
